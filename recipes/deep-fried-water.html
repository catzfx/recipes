    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix up water and sodium alginate.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix up water and calcium chloride.</li>
        <li>Take a few spoons of the first bowl's contents, and carefully insert them into the second bowl.</li>
        <li>While we're waiting for the solution to solidify, prepare plates with flour, scrambled egg whites and yolks, and breadcrumbs, and put a pan on medium heat, pouring the vegetable oil in it.</li>
        <li>Carefully take out the water 'bubbles' formed in the bowl from step 3 with a soft instrument (ideally your hand), then soak them in the flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs, then drop them in the pan.</li>
        <li>After a few seconds, take them out.</li>
    </ol>
